Abstract

   This document defines how the X.509 certificates can be issued by a
   trust anchor and its intermediates through the ACME protocol to all
   the organizations that are part of a federation built on top of
   OpenID Connect Federation 1.0.

1.  Introduction

   The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) is the
   standard [RFC8555] that allows obtaining certificates for websites
   (HTTPS [RFC2818]) by verifing the "fully-qualified" domain names
   [RFC3696] and the web servers within these.

   OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 [OIDC-FED] is the standard that allows
   building multilateral federations through a trust evaluation
   mechanism attesting the possession of public keys, signature
   capabilities, protocol specific metadata and several administrative
   and tecnical information in the form of trust marks, related to a
   specific entity belonging to an organization.

   OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 allow an ACME server to issue X.509
   certificates to one or more than a single organization without having
   pre-established any direct relationship or any stipulation of a
   contract to the requestor.  In a multilateral federation, composed by
   thousands of entities belonging to different organizations, all the
   participants adhere to the same regulation or trust framework.
   OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 allows each participant to recognize
   the other participant using a trust evaluation mechanism, using
   RESTful services and cryptographic materials.

   This specification defines how ACME and OpenID Connect Federation 1.0
   can be integrated allowing an efficient issuance of X.509 to a
   requestor, reducing both the bureaucratic and the implementative
   costs, since:

   *  It does not require the involvement of other resources than the
      ACME newOrder endpoint, since the authentication and authorization
      of the requestor is asserted with OpenID Federation 1.0.

   *  Instead of the /.well-known/acme-challenge/{token} endpoint it
      defines how to use and validate a basic OpenID Connect Federation
      component, called Entity Configuration, that is a signed JWT
      published in a well-known resource (.well-known/openid-federation)
      published by the requestor.

   *  It removes the requirement for the authentication of an entity and
      the provisioning of the _acme-challenge token_, since the
      authorization mechanisms is built on top of the trust evaluation
      model as defined in OpenID Connect Federation 1.0.

   *  It extends the ACME newOrder endpoint, defining a new payload
      identifier type called openid-federation.

   *  It defines how the OpenID Federation Entity Statements can be used
      for the publication of the X.509 certificates, by a trust anchor
      or intermediate, that was previously issued with ACME.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Audience Target audience/Usage

   The audience of the document are the multilateral federations that
   require automatic issuance oif X.509 certificates using an
   infrastructure of trust based on OpenID Connect Federation 1.0.

4.  Scope

   This specification defines how a [OIDC-FED] Federation API is used by
   ACME in the authorization phase for the issuance of the certificates.
