Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) with OpenID Connect

              draft-demarco-acme-openid-federation-latest

Abstract

   The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) is the
   standard [RFC8555] that allows obtaining certificates for websites
   (HTTPS [RFC2818]) by verifing the "fully-qualified" domain names
   [RFC3696] and the web servers that publishes contents within them.

   OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 [OIDC-FED] is a general purpose trust
   evaluation mechanism that allow to attests the public keys and
   several administrative and protocol specific information related to a
   specific entity belongin to an organization, with the involvement of
   a trusted third party and the signed material published in their web
   services.

   This document defines how an ACME server can issue X.509 certificates
   to organizations at a large scale thanks to the OpenID Connect
   Federation 1.0 trust evaluation mechanism, where domains, web service
   and cryptographic materials are attested under the sole control of a
   trusted entity.

1.  Introduction

   ACME in conjuction with OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 is able to
   issue X.509 certificates to one or more than a single organization
   without having pre-established any direct relationship of trust or
   stipulation of a contract between the parties.  OpenID Connect
   Federation 1.0 enables trust building in multilateral federated
   contexts, where all participants adhere to the same regulation or
   trust framework.  The OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 trust evaluation
   mechanisms guarranties that an organization is part of the common
   regulation, established by the federation.

   This specification integrates ACME with OpenID Connect Federation
   1.0, allowing the issuance of X.509 using an authorization pattern
   that identifies the requesting organization and attests to it the
   reliability and the right to request a certificate, since:

   *  It does not require the involvement of other resources than the
      newOrder, since the authentication and authorization of the
      requestor is asserted with OpenID Federation 1.0.

   *  It extends the ACME newOrder resource, defining the payload
      identifier type openid-federation

   *  It defines how the OpenID Federation Entity Statements are used
      for the publication of the X.509 certificates issued with ACME.

3.  Audience Target audience/Usage

   The audience of the document are the multilateral federations that
   require automatic issuance oif X.509 certificates using an
   infrastructure of trust based on OpenID Connect Federation 1.0.

4.  Scope

   This specification defines how a [OIDC-FED] Federation API is used by
   ACME in the authorization phase for the issuance of the certificates.
