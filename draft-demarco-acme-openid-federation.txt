              draft-demarco-acme-openid-federation-latest

Abstract

   The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) is the
   standard [RFC8555] that allows obtaining certificates for websites
   (HTTPS [RFC2818]) by verifing the "fully-qualified" domain names
   [RFC3696] and the web servers within these.

   OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 [OIDC-FED] is the standard that allows
   building multilateral federations through a trust evaluation
   mechanism attesting the possession of public keys, signature
   capabilities, protocol specific metadata and several administrative
   and tecnical information in the form of trust marks, related to a
   specific entity belonging to an organization.

   This document defines how the X.509 certificates can be issued by a
   trust anchor and its intermediates through the ACME protocol to all
   the organizations that are part of a federation built on top of
   OpenID Connect Federation 1.0.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 allows an ACME server to issue X.509
   certificates to one or more than a single organization without having
   pre-established any direct relationship or any stipulation of a
   contract.  In a multilateral federation, composed by thousands of
   entities belonging to different organizations, all the participants
   adhere to the same regulation or trust framework.  OpenID Connect
   Federation 1.0 allows each participant to recognize the other
   participant using a trust evaluation mechanism, with RESTful services
   and cryptographic materials.

   Considering that a requestor is an entity requesting the issuance of
   a X.509 certificate to a server and the issuer is the ACME server
   that validates the entitlements of the requestor before issuing the
   X.509 certificate, this specification defines how ACME and OpenID
   Connect Federation 1.0 can be integrated allowing an efficient
   issuance of X.509 to a requestor, reducing both the bureaucratic and
   the implementative costs, since:

   *  It does not require the involvement of other resources than the
      ACME newNonce and newOrder endpoints, since the authentication and
      authorization of the requestor is asserted with OpenID Federation
      1.0.

   *  Instead of the /.well-known/acme-challenge/{token} endpoint it
      defines how to use and validate a basic OpenID Connect Federation
      component, called Entity Configuration, that is a signed JWT
      published in a well-known resource (/.well-known/openid-
      federation).

   *  It removes the requirement for the authentication of an entity and
      the provisioning of the _acme-challenge token_, since the
      authorization mechanisms is built on top of the trust evaluation
      model as defined in OpenID Connect Federation 1.0.

   *  It extends the ACME newOrder endpoint, defining a new payload
      identifier type called openid-federation.

   *  It defines how the OpenID Federation Entity Statements can be used
      for the publication of the X.509 certificates, by a trust anchor
      or intermediate, that was previously issued with ACME.

2.  Audience Target and Use Cases

   The audience of the document are the multilateral federations that
   require automatic issuance of X.509 certificates using an
   infrastructure of trust based on OpenID Connect Federation 1.0.

   This specification can be implemented by:

   *  Federation Entities that joins to a federation staging area using
      HTTP only transport to attests themselves as trustworhty, and then
      ask X.509 certificates for their official HTTPs Federation Entity
      ID.

   *  Federation Entities that want to ask and obtain X.509 certificate
      for every Federation Key contained in their Entity Configuration,
      as made recognizable in a Federation Trust Chain.

3.  Terminology

   *ACME*, Automated Certificate Management Environment, a certificate
   management protocol [RFC8555].

   *TA*, OpenID Connect Federation Trust Anchor, see CA

   *CA*, Certification Authority, also known as Trust Anchor or
   Intermediate, specifically one that implements the ACME protocol by
   serving an ACME server.

   *CSR*, Certificate Signing Request, specifically a PKCS#10 [RFC2986]
   as supported by ACME.

   *FQDN*, Fully Qualified Domain Name.

   *Requestor*, Federation Entity that requests a X.509 certificate to a
   CA.

   *Issuer*, Federation Entity that serves an ACME Server.  The
   Federation Entity is then a CA.

   The terms "Federation Entity", "Trust Anchor", "Intermediate",
   "Entity Configuration", "Entity Statement", "Trust Mark" and "Trust
   Chain" used in this document are defined in the Section 1.2
   (https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html#name-
   terminology) of [OIDC-FED].

4.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

5.  Certificates issued using OIDC Federation

   The Federation Entity Keys are used for requesting X.509
   certificates.

   The Issuer establishes the authorization of a Federation Entity to
   obtain certificates for the identifier configured in the Requestor's
   Entity Configuration.

   The protocol assumes the following discovery preconditions are met,
   the Issuer MUST then have the guarranty that:

   1.  The Requestor controls the private key related to the public part
       published in its Entity Configuration, attested by the superior
       Entity Statement.

   2.  The Requestor controls the identifier in question, having
       published the Entity Configuration and having signed it using the
       private key related to the public one related to the CSR.

   This process may be repeated to request multiple certificates related
   to the Federation Entity Keys and linked to a single identifier,
   that's the Federation Entity FQDN.

6.  Protocol Flow

   This section presents the protocol flow.  The protocol flow is
   subdivided in the following phases:

   *  *Discovery*, the Requestor obtains the available CAs within a
      federation.

   *  *Order request*, the Requestor requests a X.509 certificate to a
      CA.

6.1.  Discovery Preconditions

   The protocol assumes the following discovery preconditions are met,
   where for discovery is intended the phase where a Requestor searches
   an Issuer to requests an X.509 certificate.

   1.  The Requestor and the Issuer MUST publish their Entity
       Configuration as defined in the Section 6
       (https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-
       1_0.html#name-obtaining-federation-entity) of [OIDC-FED].

   2.  The Requestor and the Issuer MUST be able to establish the trust
       to each other obtaining the Trust Chain of each other, as defined
       in the Section 3.2 (https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-
       federation-1_0.html#name-trust-chain) of [OIDC-FED].

   3.  The Trust Anchor and its Intermediates SHOULD implement an ACME
       server with at least the newNonce and the newOrder endpoints, as
       extended accordingly by this document.

   4.  The Issuer MUST publish in its Entity Configuration, within the
       metadata parameter as defined in the Section 4
       (https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-
       1_0.html#name-metadata-type-identifiers) of [OIDC-FED], the
       metadata type acme_provider according to the Section 6.3 of this
       specification.

   5.  The Issuer MAY be a Leaf, in these cases a specific Trust Mark
       SHOULD be issued by the Trust Anchor, or on behalf of it by an
       allowed Trust Mark issuer as configured in the federation, and.
       the Trust Mark MUST then be published within the Leaf Entity
       Configuration.

   Where the precondition number 4 and number 5 are not met, there MAY
   be some cases where the Requestor known a priori which are the
   Issuers in one or more federations, in these cases the Requestor
   directly requests the issuance of the X.509 certificate to the
   trusted Issuer.

6.2.  Overview

   TBD: high level design and ascii sequence diagram.

   1.  The Requestor checks if its superior Federation Entity supports
       the ACME protocol for OpenID Connect Federation 1.0.  If not, the
       Requestor starts the discovery process to find which are the
       Issuers within the federation.

   2.  The Requestor requests and obtains a new nonce from the Issuer,
       by sending a HTTP HEAD request to the Issuer's newNonce resource;

   3.  The Issuer evaluates the trust to the Requestor by checking if it
       is part of the federation.  If not the newNonce request MUST be
       rejected (*TBD* the error to return).  There are two ways the
       Issuer is able to check if a Requestor is part of the federation,
       these are listed below:

       *  The Requestor adds the Trust Chain JWS header parameter
          related to itself, this option is RECOMMENDED since it reduces
          the effort of the Issuer in evaluating the trust to the
          Requestor;

       *  The Requestor doesn't add the Trust Chain in the request, then
          the Issuer MUST start a Federation Entity Discovery
          (https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-
          1_0.html#section-8) to obtain the Trust Chain related to the
          Requestor.

   4.  The Requestor begins the certificate issuance process by sending
       a HTTP POST request to the Issuer's newOrder resource.

   Below is represented the summary of all the actions supported by the
   protocol defined in this document.

   +=================+===========================+====================+
   | Action          | Request                   | Succesful Response |
   +=================+===========================+====================+

   +-----------------+---------------------------+--------------------+

                                 Table 1

6.3.  Metadata

   The Issuer MUST publish its Entity Configuration including the
   acme_provider metadata within it.

   This section describe how to use the parameters defined in the
   Section 7.1.1 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-
   7.1.1) of [RFC8555] in the federation Entity Configuration of the
   Issuer.

   { "metadata": "acme_provider": { "newNonce":
   "https://issuer.example.com/acme/new-nonce", "newOrder":
   "https://issuer.example.com/acme/new-order", "revokeCert":
   "https://issuer.example.com/acme/revoke-cert", "keyChange":
   "https://issuer.example.com/acme/key-change", "meta": {
   "termsOfService": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/terms/2017-5-30",
   "website": "https://www.issuer.example.com/", "caaIdentities":
   ["issuer.example.com"], "externalAccountRequired": false } }

6.4.  newNonce request

   The Requestor MUST obtain a new nonce from the Issuer, according to
   the Section 7.2 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/
   rfc8555#section-7.2) of [RFC8555].

   Below a non-normative example of the request:

   ```` HEAD /acme/new-nonce HTTP/1.1 Host: issuer.example.com

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK Replay-Nonce: oFvnlFP1wIhRlYS2jTaXbA Cache-Control:
   no-store ````

   Differences with [RFC8555]:

   *  The HTTP header Link: <https://issuer.example.com/acme/
      directory>;rel="index" is not required.

6.5.  newOrder request

   The certificate issuance request is made by sending a HTTP POST to
   the Issuer newOrder resource, where the body of the POST is a JWS
   object whose JSON payload is a subset of the _ACME order object_, as
   defined in the Section 7.4 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/
   rfc8555#section-7.4) of [RFC8555].

   The _ACME order object_ represents the request for a certificate
   issuance and is used to track the progress of that order through to
   issuance (see the Section 7.1.6
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.1.6) of
   [RFC8555] for any further information about the statuses).

   ```` POST /acme/new-order HTTP/1.1 Host: issuer.example.com Content-
   Type: application/jose+json

   { "protected": base64url({ "alg": "ES256", "kid": "1", "nonce":
   "5XJ1L3lEkMG7tR6pA00clA", "url": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/
   new-order", "trust_chain": ["eyJhbGciOiJFU ...", "eyJhbGci ..."] }),
   "payload": base64url({ "identifiers": [{ "type": "openid-federation",
   "value": "requestor.example.org" }], "notBefore":
   "2024-01-01T00:04:00+04:00", "notAfter": "2024-01-08T00:04:00+04:00"
   }), "signature": "H6ZXtGjTZyUnPeKn...wEA4TklBdh3e454g" } ````

6.6.  Order Object Extensions and Constraints

   To the _ACME order object_ properties already defined in the
   Section 7.1.3 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-
   7.1.3) of [RFC8555] are added those defined by this document and
   listed below, to be intended as extensions to [RFC8555].

    +===========+=============+============+==========+===============+
    | place     | parameter   | type       | presence | reference     |
    +===========+=============+============+==========+===============+
    | protected | trust_chain | JSON Array | OPTIONAL | [OIDC-FED],   |
    | headers   |             | of JWS     |          | Section 3.2.1 |
    +-----------+-------------+------------+----------+---------------+

                                  Table 2

   When OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 is used by the Issuer to attest
   the reliabiability of a Requestor, the following constraints to the
   payload.identifiers JSON Array MUST be respected:

   *  type MUST be set to openid-federation;

   *  value MUST correspond to the FQDN contained within the iss
      parameter of the Requestor's Entity Configuration.  Since the
      Federation Entity ID is a HTTP URL, the corresponding FQDN MUST be
      extracted from it.  For example, if the iss parameter withing the
      Entity Configuration contains the value
      https://requestor.example.org/oidc/rp, the extracted FQDN is then
      requestor.example.org and it MUST correspond to the value of the
      identifier contained in the order object;

   *  the maximum length of the JSON Array contained in the identifiers
      parameter MUST be 1, since there cannot be more than a single FQDN
      corresponding to a single Federation Entity.  If other identifiers
      are present in the request and different from the type openid-
      federation, these SHOULD be ignored.

6.7.  newOrder Response

   The server MUST return an error if it cannot fulfill the request as
   specified, and it MUST NOT issue a certificate with contents other
   than those requested.  If the server requires the request to be
   modified in a certain way, it should indicate the required changes
   using an appropriate error type and description.

   If the server is willing to issue the requested certificate, it
   responds with a 201 (Created) response.  The body of this response is
   an order object reflecting the client's request and any
   authorizations the client must complete before the certificate will
   be issued.

   ```` HTTP/1.1 201 Created Replay-Nonce: MYAuvOpaoIiywTezizk5vw
   Location: https://issuer.example.com/acme/order/TOlocE8rfgo

   { "status": "pending", "expires": "2016-01-05T14:09:07.99Z",

   "notBefore": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z", "notAfter":
   "2016-01-08T00:00:00Z",

   "identifiers": [{ "type": "openid-federation", "value":
   "requestor.example.org" }],

   "finalize": "https://example.com/acme/order/TOlocE8rfgo/finalize" }
   ````

   Differences with [RFC8555]:

   *  The HTTP Header Link is not required

   *  The authorizations arrays is not required an MUST be omitted from
      the order object.

6.8.  Finalize Request

   Once the client believes it has fulfilled the server's requirements,
   it should send a POST request to the order resource's finalize URL.
   The POST body MUST include a CSR in the form of a string.

   The CSR encodes the parameters for the certificate being requested
   [RFC2986].  The CSR is sent in the base64url-encoded version of the
   DER format.  Please note that the value is encoded in base64url and
   does not include headers, then it is different from PEM.

   Below a non-normative example of the finalize made via HTTP POST:

   ```` POST /acme/order/TOlocE8rfgo/finalize HTTP/1.1 Host:
   issuer.example.com Content-Type: application/jose+json

   { "protected": base64url({ "alg": "ES256", "kid": "1", "nonce":
   "MSF2j2nawWHPxxkE3ZJtKQ", "url":
   "https://issuer.example.com/acme/order/TOlocE8rfgo/finalize"

   }), "payload": base64url({ "csr":
   "MIIBPTCBxAIBADBFMQ...FS6aKdZeGsysoCo4H9P", }), "signature":
   "uOrUfIIk5RyQ...nw62Ay1cl6AB" } ````

   The CSR encodes the client's requests with regard to the content of
   the certificate to be issued.  The CSR MUST indicate the exact same
   set of requested identifiers as the initial newOrder request.
   Identifiers of type "dns" MUST appear either in the commonName
   portion of the requested subject name or in an extensionRequest
   attribute [RFC2985] requesting a subjectAltName extension, or both.

6.9.  Finalize Response

   If a request to finalize an order is successful, the server will
   return a 200 (OK) with an updated order object.  The status of the
   order will indicate what action the client should take, these action
   values are defined in the Section 7.4
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.4) of
   [RFC8555].

   ```` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Replay-Nonce: CGf81JWBsq8QyIgPCi9Q9X Location:
   https://issuer.example.com/acme/order/TOlocE8rfgo

   "certificate": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/cert/mAt3xBGaobw" }
   ````

   Differences with [RFC8555]:

   *  The HTTP Header Link is not required

6.10.  Downloading the Certificate

   The request and the response are fully compliant to the Section 7.4.2
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.4.2) defined
   in [RFC8555].

   Below a non-normative example of a request:

   ```` POST /acme/cert/mAt3xBGaobw HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Content-
   Type: application/jose+json Accept: application/pem-certificate-chain

7.  Federation Identifiers Types

   The "ACME Identifier Types" registry defined in the Section 9.7.7
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-9.7.7) of
   [RFC8555] is extended with the types of identifiers listed below.

8.  Certificate Lifecycle and Revocation

   *TBD*.

   The issued Certificates are related to the Federation Key attested
   within a Trust Chain, their expiration time MUST be equal to the
   expiration of the Trust Chain.

   When a Federation Key is removed from the Entity Statement that
   attests it, and then it cannot be attested though a Trust Chain, the
   certificate related to it MUST be revoked by its Issuer, if not
   expired.

   A Requestor SHOULD request the revocation of its Certificate when the
   related Federation Entity Key is revoked and published in the
   Federation Historical Key Registry.

   The certficate revocation request is defined in the Section 7.6
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.6) of
   [RFC8555].
